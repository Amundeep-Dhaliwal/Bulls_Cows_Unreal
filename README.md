# Bulls_Cows_Unreal
This is the C++ source/header file for a terminal the player can interact with and guess a word that is an isogram.

The hidden words list is a list of isograms, one of these words is used in the implementation as the hiddenword that the player has to try and guess.

The player is then shown a count of bulls that represent letters that match in position. Another integer is shown which is the cow count which is the number of characters that match in both the guess and the hidden word.
